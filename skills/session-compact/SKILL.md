# Session Compact

Use AI DevKit's Jev-backed CLI to create a structured continuation artifact from a historical session. Prefer this command over a hand-written compact when it is available.

## When to Use

- Context is getting long and useful state needs to survive compaction.
- Work is being handed to another agent or resumed after becoming stale.
- A complex implementation or debugging session is closing.
- Durable memory candidates or task-progress facts need to be identified after a long run.

## Workflow

1. Find the session ID when it is not already known:
   ```bash
   ai-devkit agent sessions --all
   ```
2. Produce Markdown for a human handoff:
   ```bash
   ai-devkit agent session compact --id <session-id>
   ```
3. Use JSON for automation or structured inspection:
   ```bash
   ai-devkit agent session compact --id <session-id> --format json
   ```
4. Add `--type <provider>` when the same session ID is ambiguous across providers.
5. Review the artifact before using its resume prompt, memory candidates, or validation claims. Compaction preserves selected transcript evidence; it does not independently verify that evidence.

## Jev Availability

The command requires `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. If it reports:

```text
Jev is unavailable because TYPESAFE_API_KEY is not set.
```

report that result clearly and stop the compaction attempt. Do not silently replace it with hand-written summarization or imply that Jev classified the session. A user may explicitly request a separate manual summary afterward.

Never print, log, store, or pass the API key as a command argument. The CLI reads it from the environment.

## Boundaries

- The command is read-only and does not write memories or mutate tasks.
- Treat memory candidates as proposals until they pass the memory skill's quality gate.
- Record task progress separately when the task workflow requires it.
- API, authentication, schema, or network failures with a configured key are errors, not Jev-unavailable results.
